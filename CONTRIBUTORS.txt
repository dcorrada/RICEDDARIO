## Good Development Practices for Contributors

The versioning of the **RICEDDARIO** is managed by git. For more information please read tips and tricks at [http://git-scm.com/book/](http://git-scm.com/book/).

In order to become a contributor of **RICEDDARIO** you must generate a public/private key pair. Then, create a copy of your public key file renamed as `[contributor_name].pub` and send it to [dario.corrada@gmail.com](dario.corrada@gmail.com).

Every new contributor has to register him/her credentials:

    $ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
    $ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

### 1. BRANCHES

The last stable release of **RICEDDARIO** is mantained on the branch `master`. The developers version is mantained on the branch `brandnew`, which will be periodically merged with the branch `master`.

Other remote branches are already available for the developement of individual parts of **RICEDDARIO**:

    $ git branch -r

You are free of creating new branches as well. Nevertheless, all contributors' branches will be merged with the `brandnew` branch when issues/developements have been accomplished:

    $ git branch issueX
    $ git checkout issueX
    
    [your stuffs]
    
    $ git checkout brandnew
    $ git pull origin brandnew
    $ git merge issueX

    [updating changelogs on the branch brandnew]

    $ git push origin brandnew

#### 1. 1. Editing Change Logs

The summary changelog of **RICEDDARIO** is mantained by the following file:

* RELEASE.NOTES.txt
* TREE.txt

The `RELEASE.NOTES.txt` file will contain a general list of changes made, the file `TREE.txt` is a site map of the package **RICEDDARIO**:

    $ cd /home/dario/GITs/RICEDDARIO
    $ date > date.txt
    $ tree -F -n ./ > TREEnew.txt
    $ cat date.txt TREEnew.txt > TREE.txt
    $ rm date.txt
    $ rm TREEnew.txt

### 2. TAGS AND STABLE RELEASES

Any merge between branches `master` and `brandnew` will be flagged by a new release tag.

Occasionally, relevant commits may be directly merged with the `master` branch. Anyway, such decision is restricted to the administrator [dario.corrada@gmail.com](dario.corrada@gmail.com).
