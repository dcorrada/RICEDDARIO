Description: MyMir is a package with functions for collecting miRNA target 
        from a defined database and find statistically over-represented 
        target/functional annotation relationships. Over-represented ontologies 
        can also be clustered together by applying the semantic similarity 
        criterion. This package allows to perform a partitional clustering
        procedure in order to highlight the most similar over-represented
        ontologies.
