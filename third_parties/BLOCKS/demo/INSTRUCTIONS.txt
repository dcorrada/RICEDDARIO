*** STEP 01: PREPARE INPUT SCRIPT FILE ***
The <blocks.inp> file is an input script file in which different parameters are 
passed to the BLOCKS program:

    NRES        total number of eigenvectors.
    
    FRACT       threshold for considering the eigenvectors (Recommended: 0.6). 
                FRACT=0.6 means that we select only  eigenvectors whose 
                eigenvalue is, in absolute value,greater than or equal to 
                0.6*abs(eigval(1)) where eigval(1) is the lowest eigenvalue.
    
    TOTAL       logical variable to indicate if considering NRES eigenvectors 
                (total=.true.) or only the selected ones (logical=.false.) in 
                the computation of the median for the binary discretization.
    
    NTM         maximum number of times that a component can be covered 
                (Recommended: 3).
    
    PERCOMP     maximum fraction of the total number of components that can be 
                covered NTM times (Recommended: 0.5).
    
    NGRAIN      side-length of the starting diagonal tesserae in the first step.
    
    LENGTH      minimal domain dimensions.

The parameters list must be flanked by "$PARAMS" and "$END" flags. A typical 
input script file will contain a line like this:
    
    $PARAMS  NRES=309 FRACT=0.6d0 TOTAL=.TRUE. NTM=3 PERCOMP=0.5 NGRAIN=5 \
    LENGTH=50 $END


*** STEP 02: PRODUCTION RUN ***
You need to have three input files with the exactly filename as follows:

    fort.30     eigenvectors of the non-bonded interaction energy matrix
    
    fort.31     eigenvalues of the non-bonded interaction energy matrix
    
    fort.35     contact-matrix for furhter refinement of the domain-subdivision

Copy the input templates and run the program:
    
    $ ../BLOCKS.64bit < ./blocks.inp > ./blocks.out
    
BLOCKS will produce three additional output file (other than the normal STDOUT 
redirected to the file blocks.out):

    fort.32     selected eigenvectors
    
    fort.33     non-bonded interaction energy matrix in gnuplot format
    
    fort.34     non-bonded interaction energy matrix in gnuplot format
