Get a PDB file, named something like "myprot.pdb" and put your PDB file in a 
fresh new newly "elec" directory.

In this directory edit the file "delphi.param" and change the PDB file name to 
the name you chose. Run DelPhi in that directory:

    $ delphi delphi.param

Change the name of the "fort.20" file to something that ends with ".phi", for 
example "mymap.phi":

    $ mv fort.20 mymap.phi

Start a PyMol session in this directory:

    $ pymol myprot.pdb

You need the map, e.g. "mymap.phi", and the PDB file, e.g. "myprot.pdb". Show 
the surface of your molecule in the PyMol menu:

    => myprot => show => surface

Load the electrostatic grid in PyMol:

    PyMOL> load mymap.phi, e_map

This grid is now an object in your PyMol menu called "e_map". Create a color 
ramp in PyMol:

    PyMOL> ramp_new e_lvl, e_map, [-7, 0, 7]

This color ramp is now an object in your PyMol menu called "e_lvl". Color the 
surface according to the grid and map:

    PyMOL> set surface_color, e_lvl, myprot

The term "myprot" in this command should be the name of your molecule. You can 
change the color scale on the fly in PyMol by issuing another "ramp_new" command 
with other numbers (this makes it have more red and blue):

    PyMOL> ramp_new e_lvl, e_map, [-3, 0, 3]

The 3 numbers are red-point, white-point and blue-point, respectively. The scale 
can also be changed by [ctrl+mid-click] while you drag the color scale. You can 
also change the quality of the surface in the PyMol in the control window with 
the PyMol menu:

    => Setting => Edit All... => surface_quality => 2

You will need to wait a few minutes (give it 5 at least) for PyMol to calculate 
the surface with this setting. It only needs to calculate the surface once, and 
it will rotate and move fairly easily after that, but will look DAMN GOOD too.
