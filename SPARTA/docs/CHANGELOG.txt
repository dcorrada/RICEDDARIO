>UPDATES
2012-04-23: analysis mode
    - [ene|flu]dist modes: statistic test (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) of hotspots distributions between apo and holo forms, for each Ig domain
2012-04-19: analysis mode
    - Structural annotation added to .pml files
2012-04-13: analysis mode
    - New statistic test for [ene|flu]stat modes; distribution analysis can be now performed by choosing parametric (Student T test) or non-parametric (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, default); see also Leonidas::hotspot_stats 
2012-04-12: analysis mode
    - New implementation of [ene|flu]dist modes, based on two sample rank products algorithm (see Koziol, FEBS letters, 2010, 584: 4481-4484)
>PATCHES
2012-04-12: analysis mode
    - Changes in [ene|flu]stat modes; histogram show all hotspots per domain, nor grouped by intra-/inter-chain
2012-04-04: analysis mode
    - Code optimization, IERPs and RMRPs analyses are performed by the same methods of Leonidas, Chilon and Theodorus

*** SPARTA - release 12.03.alpha ***

2012-03-26: database maintenance mode (fludecomp, fludist, flumatrix)
    - new subroutines in order to collect data of global distance fluctuations (see EMMA.pl for more details)
2012-03-12: analysis modes (cluster)
    - clusters found by GMX g_cluster analysis
2012-03-06: analysis modes
    - subroutines for investiganting IERP (enestat)
>PATCHES
2012-03-29: database maintenance mode (enedecomp)
    - table "decomp" is now renamed as "enedecomp", cutoff filter is disabled
2012-03-26: database maintenance mode (fluctuations)
    - table "flucts" is now replaced by table "rmsf", containing only data related to Root Mean Square Fluctuation

*** SPARTA - release 12.02.alpha ***

    - memory usage monitor
>PATCHES
2012-02-16: multithreading
    - demanding of multithread processes to each object have been created
2012-02-09: memory starvation
    - garbage collection for multithread processes

*** SPARTA - release 12.01.alpha ***
> UPDATES
2012-01-31: flumatrix subroutine
    - first multithreading approach: seems good...
2012-01-24: analysis modes
    - first release
2012-01-11: subroutine "structure"
    - re-definition of region 'CDR-L3'
    - new annotations (framework regions among variable domains,       C-terms, intra-domain hinge regions)
> PATCHES
2012-01-11: PDB structure 1YQV
    - The N-term of the light chain is a MET where an ASP residue is expected from abnum web-service. A new PDB file (~/simulazioni/dataset/PDBapo/1YQV_patched.pdb) was built in order to run abnum service. Nevertheless, SPARTA DB and the other job still rely on the original structure.
