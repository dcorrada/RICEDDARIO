Using ssh-keygen for secure connections

SSH generates a private and a public key. The public key can be put on the 
machines you wish to communicate with. SSH will then connect to those machines 
with keys instead of your standard password.

Let's get started by creating a pair of keys for your workstation from which 
you'll be connecting to your various servers:

    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa

ssh-keygen will prompt you for the file where you wish to save your private key. 
This is the key that will only be on your machine and not given out to others. 
It will be called id_rsa. The file should be located in the .ssh directory 
inside your home directory.

Next it will prompt for the passphrase you wish to use. This is basically the 
password for your key. Just press the [ENTER] key for no password.

Now if you list the contents of your .ssh directory you should see your private 
and public key.

    $ ls .ssh

Now that you have generated your keys you need to put your public keys in the 
authorized keys file on all the machines you wish to connect to using ssh.
